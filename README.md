## Feed-Em-All

Hunger kills more people than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined.
However, on the other hand, one third of the food prepared is wasted. I have
seen several restaurants, grocery stores, cafes and bakeries throw away food
because it is expired. We wondered if there was a way for businesses to get
these food to people in need of them.This pressing issue has been there for a
long time and there is no proper use of technology to mitigate the situation.

Our website lets restaurants update it when they have excess food typically at
the end of the day when they are closing and volunteers in that region can help
distribute the food to the people in need of it. Volunteers are notified when a
restaurant in their region is giving away food via SMS who can then contact the
restaurant and collect it.

This project contains Java code for the REST Web Services implemented using
Jersey REST API.

Used Java Jersey REST API as backend and angularJS for the front end.
mongoDB hosted on mLab was our database. The website is hosted on
DigitalOcean.
Used tropo API to send SMS notifications.
Used Uber API to get a fair estimate from the volunteers location to the
restaurant.
Used Google Geocode API to get address auto fill and fetch lat long values.
